# Milestone 1: Project Overview

<!-- This project involves building a full-fledged E-Commerce Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The first milestone focuses on understanding the structure of a MERN project, setting up the repository, and exploring key features of an e-commerce platform.

Key Highlights:
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration using hashed passwords and token-based authentication.
- Product Management: Admins can add, edit, and delete products, while users can browse and filter them.
- Order Handling: Customers can place orders, track statuses, and view purchase history, while admins manage orders.
- Database Design: MongoDB stores user, product, and order data efficiently.
- Frontend Development: React.js ensures a responsive and user-friendly shopping experience.
- Backend Development: Node.js and Express.js handle business logic, API requests, and security. -->
