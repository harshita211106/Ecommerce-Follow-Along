# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Milestone 1: Project Overview to summarize what was covered in the session
Summary:
     This repository contains the follow-along project for building a full-fledged E-Commerce Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)
     
Objectives:
      Understand the structure of a MERN stack project.
      Learn how to set up a project repository and organize it.
      Grasp the core features and functionalities of an e-commerce application, such as user authentication, product management, and order handling.

Key features:
    1. User Authentication: Make sure users can securely log in and register with ease. Passwords will be safely hashed, and users will get tokens to stay logged in without needing to enter their credentials every time.
    2. Product Management: Admins will have the power to add, edit, or delete products with all the details like name, price, and description. Shoppers can browse, search, and filter products easily, and every product entry will be double-checked to ensure no mistakes slip through.
    3. Order Handling: Customers can place orders, track their progress (like "Shipped" or "Delivered"), and view their purchase history. Admins will have tools to manage all orders, update their status, and handle requests like cancellations.
    4. Database Schema Design: MongoDB will store all the app's data, from users and products to orders. The database will be thoughtfully structured to link related data 
    5. Frontend Development: The user interface will be built with React.js, ensuring itâ€™s both beautiful and easy to use. From a smooth shopping experience to a dashboard for admins to manage everything, the app will work seamlessly on all devices, big or small.
    6. Backend Development: The backend will handle all the heavy lifting, like processing data, handling business logic, and making sure everything runs smoothly. Node.js and Express.js will keep things robust and scalable, with extra layers of security to protect sensitive data.

#### **Key Accomplishments:**

1. **Project Structure:**
   - Organized the project into two main directories: `frontend` for the user interface and `backend` for the server and API logic.
   - Created a clean and modular folder hierarchy to enable scalability and maintainability.

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Initialized a React application for building the user interface.
   - Configured **Tailwind CSS** to streamline styling with modern, responsive, and utility-first design principles.
   - Developed the **Login Page**, which includes:
     - A form with input fields for email and password.
     - Utility-based styling for an aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout.
---

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
- **Frontend Development:** Gained hands-on experience with React and Tailwind CSS for building responsive UIs.
- **Project Organization:** Improved project structuring and modularity for future scalability.
- **Version Control:** Practiced committing changes, managing branches, and pushing updates to GitHub.

This project sets a solid foundation for the development of a feature-rich e-commerce platform. Future steps include integrating authentication functionality, building APIs, and adding more user-facing features like product listings and shopping cart functionality.
